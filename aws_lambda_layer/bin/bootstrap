# AWS Lambda Layer Bootstrap Script for X-Ray Instrumentation
#
# This script modifies the Python runtime environment to include additional
# site-packages from the Lambda layer, enabling automatic X-Ray instrumentation
# through sitecustomize.py.
#
# Environment Variables:
# - USER_SITE: Adds /opt/bin/python to Python's module search path
# - ENABLE_USER_SITE: Enables the user site-packages directory
#
# When Python starts, it will automatically import sitecustomize.py from
# /opt/bin/python, which triggers X-Ray instrumentation.

args=("$@")

# Set the user site-packages directory to include the layer's Python packages
# This allows Python to find the aws-xray-sdk and wrapt packages from the layer
export USER_SITE="/opt/bin/python"

# Enable the user site-packages directory
# This is required for Python to actually use the USER_SITE path
export ENABLE_USER_SITE="1"

# Execute the original Lambda runtime with the modified environment
